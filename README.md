# Expired Domain Hunter

Tool I developed while I was live on a Bug Bounty program, with the purpose of checking the expiration date of subdomains in a wordlist.

## Installation

This tool is so SIMPLE that there is practically no way to go wrong when using it.

```
git clone https://github.com/DavidKarpinski/expired-domain-hunter

cd expired-domain-hunter

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

This tool is so SIMPLE that there is practically no way to go wrong when using it.

```
python3 ./main.py <subdomais wordlist>
```
